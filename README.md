The goal of this project is to determine the amount (using start/end times and heart rates) and type of physical activity carried out by an individual

Specific Requirements

You are required to:

carry out thorough exploratory data analysis and appropriately handle missing or dirty data;
develop and test at least one hypothesis for a relationship between a single pair of attributes;
develop and test at least one model which uses multiple attributes to make predictions.

For this I have used the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring Dataset is used. This dataset contains data of 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor of 9 different subjects(1 female and 8 male) performing 18 various physical activities(running,rope jumping, lying etc) and the readings related to their hand,chest and ankle were noted down.
The readings of individual subject is stored as text file in .dat format. This text file contains readings of 54 different attributes(including timestamp, activity ID, heart rate and IMU sensory data).
